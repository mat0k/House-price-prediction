# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The models are trained on a dataset containing various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location to accurately predict house prices.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection and Exploration**: The dataset is loaded, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to understand the dataset's structure and relationships between variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering techniques are applied to create new features or transform existing ones, aiming to improve the models' performance.

4. **Model Training**: Two machine learning models are trained: linear regression and random forest regression. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship, while random forest builds multiple decision trees to make predictions.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using metrics such as the R-squared score, which quantifies the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.
